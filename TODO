Working on:

VRMC_springBone
dlib face detection in seperate thread


Backlog:

loader:

fbx file support (https://code.blender.org/2013/08/fbx-binary-file-format-specification/)
see files types supported by vrchat
obj file


physics:

inverse kinematics

expression recog:

opencv template matching 
clamp weights in partial deriv solver (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Ikami_Constrained_Weight_Optimization_for_Learning_Without_Activation_Normalization_WACV_2021_paper.pdf)
audio expressions calculation
make dlib68 tracker for all transforms
?change face_recognizer_dlib to be more generic (ie, regardless of camera, give similar output)
face collapse bug (seems to be related to expressions)
select correct face
other engines to look at face changes
other solving method for movement to transform

renderer:

optimize memory usage
fix emissive texture
uv animation
animation
VRMC_vrm look_at
gltf camera
GI shading
finish screen size outline mode
multiple texcoord
min max accessor
vrm emissive color change
VRMC_vrm third person
test screenCoordinates outline in vrm

GUI:

setting gui app (seperate window, maybe built in python, needs to import c header and code for face_recognizer)
move model using mouse instead of keyboard
vsync toggle
