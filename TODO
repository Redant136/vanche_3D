Working on:

improve face recognizer as it bugs out when moving head 
fix emissive texture
1 vbo per mesh for transforms
dlib face detection in seperate thread


Backlog:

physics
setting gui app (seperate window, maybe built in python, needs to import c header and code for face_recognizer)
uv animation
animation
VRMC_node_constraint
VRMC_springBone
make dlib68 tracker for all transforms
change face_recognizer_dlib to be more generic (ie, regardless of camera, give similar output)
move model using mouse instead of keyboard

face collapse bug (seems to be related to expressions)
vsync toggle
select correct face
free entire model extensions, not just model. Missing subelements free
VRMC_vrm look_at
gltf camera
GI shading
finish screen size outline mode
multiple texcoord
min max accessor
vrm emissive color change
VRMC_vrm third person
other engines to look at face changes
other solving method for movement to transform
test screenCoordinates outline in vrm
